# paint-application

This software application facilitates collaborative painting over a network, providing users with a user-friendly interface to create art with friends or colleagues in real-time. Through the program, multiple users can connect to the network at the same time, and any changes made by one user are immediately reflected across all connected users.

The application is designed to function as both a server and a client, providing the flexibility to initiate or join a collaborative painting session. While one user is required to act as the server, they can also participate in the painting session as a client, creating a seamless and inclusive experience for all users involved.

With this networked painting application, users can enjoy a fun and engaging way to work together creatively, regardless of their location or distance from each other.
